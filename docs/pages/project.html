  <h1>Project</h1>
  <h2><a id="pobjective"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#pobjective">Project Objective</a></h2>
<p>The CS205 project objective is to apply the techniques learned in class on a concrete real application to gain hands-on experience with writing and optimizing parallel code.  Your project should be oriented on a compute intensive problem, either from your research area or something you come up with from scratch (given that it fits into the time frame offered by the class).  The final report is written in the form of a proposal that can be submitted to a high performance computing center to request compute hours on a supercomputer used for your project application.  The teaching staff is in the role of the HPC admission committee and will evaluate and grade your proposal.</p>
<p>You will start with a sequential baseline implementation that serves as the reference benchmark.  This benchmark will be used as the reference case for the subsequent implementation that must run in parallel (shared memory, distributed memory or both) and is ideally</p>
<p>optimized on the node level.  The target platform are the computing resources offered by the <a href="https://ood.huit.harvard.edu/">Academic Cluster</a>. A successful project will present a performance analysis with respect to the reference case and presents results for parallel scaling and throughput.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each project group is responsible for planning and fostering the project progress and to meet the project deadlines outlined in the <a href="./schedule_static.html">schedule</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a id="project-requirements"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#project-requirements">Project Requirements</a></h3>
<p>Your project should involve the following considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>You should have a sequential baseline code of your application that you can use as a reference when benchmarking and performance analysis.</li>
<li>Demonstrate that there is potential for a parallel implementation of your chosen project application.  This may include bottleneck identification and a roofline analysis of the sequential baseline code.</li>
<li>Parallelize the problem using the techniques discussed in class.</li>
<li>It may either be a non-trivial shared memory code, distributed memory or both paradigms.</li>
<li>Additional node-level optimizations may be implemented (vectorization, code fusion to improve instruction-level parallelism)</li>
<li>Demonstrate performance (roofline analysis) and parallel scaling (weak and strong scaling) capabilities of the parallel and optimized code.</li>
<li>Identify possible limitations and further improvements of the parallel/optimized code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Projects that do include more of the listed items above or incorporate a higher level of difficulty will be weighted accordingly.  The only strict requirement is that the project code is implemented using either the <code>C</code>, <code>C++</code> or <code>Fortran</code> programming languages.</p>
<h2><a id="project-milestones"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#project-milestones">Project Milestones</a></h2>
<p>There are five milestones for your final project.  The deadlines for each milestone are shown in the <a href="./schedule_static.html">schedule</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><a href="./project.html#M1">Team formation</a></li>
<li><a href="./project.html#M2">High-level project description</a></li>
<li><a href="./project.html#M3">In-class presentation of project proposal</a></li>
<li><a href="./project.html#M4">In-class presentation of parallel design</a></li>
<li><a href="./project.html#M5">Submission of final project deliverables and final project presentation</a></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is enough time to plan ahead for each project milestone. No extensions will be granted for any milestone.  Projects submitted after the final due date will not be graded.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a id="M1"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#M1">Team Formation</a></h3>
<p>Students are required to form teams and to partition the work among the team members. The final project must be done in teams with 4-5 members each. You are free to form teams and you can use the <a href="../#class-forum">class forum</a> to find prospective team members. You may also find and discuss project ideas through the forum.</p>
<p>In general, we do not anticipate that the grades for each team member will be different. However, we reserve the right to assign different grades to each group member if it becomes apparent that one of them put in a vastly different amount of effort than the others.</p>
<h4><a id="M1-deliverable"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#M1-deliverable">Deliverables</a></h4>
<!-- TODO Change project registration -->
<!-- > 1. Report your team members and request a team ID from [`cs205-staff@g.harvard.edu`](mailto:cs205-staff@g.harvard.edu). -->
<!-- >    Your team ID will be `team01` if you are team 1 or `team10` if you are team 10 and so on. -->
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Create your team in <a href="https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/128330/groups">Canvas</a>. Your team ID will be <code>team01</code> if you are team 1 or <code>team10</code> if you are team 10 and so on.</li>
<li>The project code will be hosted in <em>private</em> repositories in the <a href="https://code.harvard.edu/CS205/">CS205 organization</a> at <code>code.harvard.edu</code>. Once you have your team ID from item 1, a member of your team creates a private repository in the CS205 organization named after your team ID (e.g. <code>team01_2024</code> if you are team 1) and adds its team members to the repository (you do not need to add the teaching staff, we will have access already).</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<h3><a id="M2"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#M2">High-Level Project Description</a></h3>
<p>A short <code>pdf</code> summary that describes your project application and briefly explains which parts of the application you plan to parallelize.  This milestone is intended as an orientation for the teaching staff such that we can get an idea of your plans and provide feedback in an early stage of the project.  The summary should be <strong>at most</strong> 1 page in text length.  Please use graphs or other visuals if they support your discussion.  Things you should consider in your report:</p>
<ul>
<li>What forms of parallelism does your project idea offer?  Make sure you have an idea what is the computational bottleneck of your problem and aim to parallelize this part.  There might be multiple possibilities that you can propose to attack.</li>
<li>How do you plan to exploit this parallelism?  Will you focus on shared memory models or distributed memory models or maybe a combination of both?  Which machine model do you think you will need for your problem (MIMD, SIMD, or
  both?)</li>
<li>To answer the first part of the previous item you should describe the size of the problem you are planning to work on and provide an estimate of how much memory it will require.  From lab 1 you know how much memory there is per node on the compute cluster and based on your memory estimate you should argue whether the chosen size of you problem is reasonable for the given amount of resources we have.</li>
<li>If your problem requires to run many simulations to generate data or other means, how long do you estimate a single run will take?  Will the solution to your problem depend on a high volume of I/O (input/output)?</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<h3><a id="M3"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#M3">In-class Presentation of Project Proposal</a></h3>
<p>Your team needs to present a project proposal that covers the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>What problem are you trying to solve with your application?</li>
<li>Describe the mathematical model and/or the data for your application in detail.  Example questions that could be answered:<ul>
<li>What are the limitations of the model?</li>
<li>In what context do you apply the model?</li>
<li>Where does the data come from?</li>
<li>How is the data transformed?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Justify the effort required to parallelize the application.  Why do you need a parallel implementation of this application?</li>
<li>Provide a draft of how you plan to parallelize the application.  What are the work packages you plan to follow? Will you be targeting a shared memory model, distributed memory model or both?  Explain the "why" here as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will have <strong>exactly 6 minutes</strong> to present your proposal. You have to prepare about 4 slides for your presentation (rule of thumb is 1.5 minutes per slide).  Each of your team member should speak once.  <em>The 6 minute time limit will be strictly enforced</em>.</p>
<p>This presentation is a chance for you to get feedback. We may suggest modifications if necessary. Our main concern is the amount of effort a given project will require; either too much or too little is unacceptable.</p>

</ol>
</blockquote>
<h3><a id="M4"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#M4">In-class Presentation of Parallel Design</a></h3>
<p>Your team needs to present the design of your parallel application that covers the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>You should have a sequential baseline of your application at this point for which you can present results for a simple test case.  Results may be presented using visuals such as simple graphs, contour plots, volume renderings or movies for example.</li>
<li>Present a profiling of your sequential baseline to identify the bottlenecks and present a simple roofline analysis of the identified compute kernels.</li>
<li>Based on your analysis above propose the forms of parallelism you want to exploit in your application and which parallel programming models you will use.  (This may deviate from the draft you presented in the <a href="./project.html#M3">previous presentation</a>.)</li>
<li>Elaborate on how you plan to implement the parallel code in terms of logic.  What is the sequence of computational steps?  Where are synchronization points?  Comment on the communication overhead you expect and whether you expect load imbalance issues.  Propose methods to hide these latencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will have <strong>exactly 6 minutes</strong> to present your proposal. You have to prepare about 4 slides for your presentation (rule of thumb is 1.5 minutes per slide).  Each of your team member should speak once.  <em>The 6 minute time limit will be strictly enforced</em>.</p>
<p>This is an important milestone/presentation.  The identification of parallelism and the methods how you exploit it is very essential for a successful parallel application.  A poor design choice may not scale at all or may even run slower than the sequential version in the worst case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This presentation is not a proposal but a design document.  You should be concrete and specific rather than abstract and general, and include real performance estimates supported by numbers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is also a chance for you to get feedback from the teaching staff and to come up with ways around roadblocks you encounter.  The presentation is important for the teaching staff such that we can ensure that the project is on track and that
your proposed work is manageable within the remaining time frame.</p>

</blockquote>
<h4><a id="M5-report"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#M5-report">Final Report</a></h4>
<!-- TODO: Change the latex requirement -->
<p>The final project report is written in the form of a proposal that can be submitted to a high performance computing center to request compute hours for a (research) project on one of their supercomputers. The report should be organized and clear. It is recommended to write it using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a>.  A template for a final report with additional instructions is given in this <a href="../pages/cs205_project_report_template.pdf"><code>pdf</code>file</a>. The corresponding <code>tex</code>file can be <a href="../pages/cs205_project_report_template.tex">downloaded here</a>. A short LaTeX tutorial can be found <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes">here</a>.  Note that collaborating with <code>tex</code> files that are tracked in a <code>git</code> repository can be troublesome due to different formatting settings of the individual contributors which will confuse <code>git</code> and result in many merge conflicts.  An alternative to work on the collaborative project report could be <a href="https://papeeria.com/landing">papeeria.com</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="M5-code"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#M5-code">Project Code</a></h4>
<p>Your final project can be implemented using any of the shared memory models and/or distributed memory models discussed in class.  You may use additional parallel programming models if you like.  The project must be implemented using either <code>C</code>, <code>C++</code> or <code>Fortran</code>.  Your code must be hosted in the team repository that has been created in the <a href="./project.html#M1">team formation</a> milestone. Include a README file that describes the code and application files, and how your program should be run.  You must include detailed instructions on how to compile and run your code. If we cannot run your application from the instructions included with your submission, we will not be able to grade this portion of your project. Your performance results should be reproducible, so you should provide all the information of the system and the environment needed to reproduce your tests.  Ideally you include the benchmark scripts you have used in your repository. Special evaluation data sets and test cases should also be available in the repository. An appropriate license should be present for the code.  Complex sections in the code should be commented extensively for comprehension and suitable software development techniques should be employed for maintainability of the code base.</p>
<h4><a id="M5-presentation"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#M5-presentation">Final Presentation</a></h4>
<p>You will be given a maximum of 12 minutes to present your final project results followed by 3 minutes of discussion time. Please prepare a suitable number of slides (rule of thumb is 1.5 minutes per slide). We will enforce the 12 minute time limit. <em>Your presentation should be a minimum of 10 minutes</em>. Focus the majority of your presentation on your main contributions and the achieved parallel performance of your application (node-level performance with roofline, parallel scaling, I/O performance).  These will be topics that follow up on the
<a href="./project.html#M4">milestone 4 presentation</a>. <em>In addition, you should briefly elaborate on future work and what insights you gained while working on the project and how they can be useful to you in the future</em>.</p>
<h2><a id="project-grading"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#project-grading">Project Grading</a></h2>
<p>The final project grades are dependent on the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty: Some projects are harder than others. For example, a project based off of one of the homework assignments is easier than a completely new application.  Adding <a href="./project.html#project-requirements">more of the project requirements</a> results in a more difficult project.  For example you may or may not choose to implement vectorized compute kernels in your project.</li>
<li>Did you meet your presented goals? An important grading criteria is functionality: A running program that produces correct results will always garner the majority of available points; no credit will be given for non-working programs. A modest solution that works correct will be considered of higher value than a very ambitious solution that randomly runs into segmentation faults.</li>
<li>Your report must contain a thorough performance and scaling analysis of your application.</li>
</ul>
<p>The project will be graded on the depth of work undertaken and how results are communicated (report, presentations, documentation in code, clarity):</p>
