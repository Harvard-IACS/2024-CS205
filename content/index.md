Title: High Performance Computing for Science and Engineering
Date: 2024-01-21
save_as: index.html

With manufacturing processes reaching the limits in terms of transistor density on todayâ€™s computing architectures, efficient utilization of computing resources must exploit parallel execution to maintain scaling. The use of computers in academia, industry and society is a fundamental tool for solving (scientific) problems while the "think parallel" mindset of code developers is still lagging behind.

The aim of CS205 is to introduce the student to the fundamentals of parallel programming and its relationship on computer architectures. Various forms of parallelism are discussed and exploited through different programming models with focus on shared and distributed memory programming.
