Title: High Performance Computing for Science and Engineering
Date: 2024-01-21
save_as: index.html

With manufacturing processes reaching the limits in terms of transistor density
on todayâ€™s computing architectures, efficient utilization of computing resources
must exploit parallel execution to maintain scaling. The use of computers in
academia, industry and society is a fundamental tool for solving (scientific)
problems while the "think parallel" mindset of code developers is still lagging
behind.

The aim of CS205 is to introduce the student to the fundamentals of parallel
programming and its relationship on computer architectures. Various forms of
parallelism are discussed and exploited through different programming models
with focus on shared and distributed memory programming.

* **Canvas:** Is used for posting grades and other class
  sensitive content: <https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/113711>
* **Gradescope:** Is used for homework and lab submissions: <https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/113711/external_tools/92289?display=borderless>
* **Class Git repository:** The handouts in CS205 are provided through the
  `main` repository hosted in the CS205 organization at
  <https://code.harvard.edu/CS205/main>.  You can clone this repository once
  you have joined the CS205 organization

```bash
git clone git@code.harvard.edu:CS205/main.git
```

  Updates to the `main` repository are posted on the <a
  href="./#class-mailinglist">class mailing list</a>. Your Harvard ID is
  required to login to <https://code.harvard.edu>. You can request
  membership in the CS205 organization by sending an email to
  `cs205-staff@g.harvard.edu` (using your `.harvard.edu` email).  You
  must include your
  [NetID](https://harvard.service-now.com/ithelp?id=kb_article&sys_id=507aca5a1b653700efd8a79b2d4bcb59)
  in the body of your email, which is also your <https://code.harvard.edu>
  username (something similar to `abc123`).

### <a id="class-forum"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#class-forum">Class Discussion Forum</a>

We will use the Ed Discussion forum on our Canvas page as our main communication
platform. Questions regarding homework, labs or lecture material must be posted
on this forum and you are encouraged to reply to questions if you know the
answer or you can share a useful contribution.  The community contribution part
in the final grade is determined through your activity on the class forum.
Please see the <a href="./pages/syllabus.html#contributions">community
contributions</a> section in the syllabus for the details.
