Title: High Performance Computing for Science and Engineering
Date: 2024-01-21
save_as: index.html

With manufacturing processes reaching the limits in terms of transistor density
on todayâ€™s computing architectures, efficient utilization of computing resources
must exploit parallel execution to maintain scaling. The use of computers in
academia, industry and society is a fundamental tool for solving (scientific)
problems while the "think parallel" mindset of code developers is still lagging
behind.

The aim of CS205 is to introduce the student to the fundamentals of parallel
programming and its relationship on computer architectures. Various forms of
parallelism are discussed and exploited through different programming models
with focus on shared and distributed memory programming.

* **Class Git repository:** The handouts in CS205 are provided through the `main` repository hosted in the CS205 organization at <https://code.harvard.edu/CS205/main_2024>.  You can clone this repository once you have joined the CS205 organization

```bash
git clone git@code.harvard.edu:CS205/main_2024.git
```

  You can request  membership in the CS205 organization by filling out [this form ](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/128330/assignments/796230)(using your `.harvard.edu` email). You  must include your [NetID](https://harvard.service-now.com/ithelp?id=kb_article&sys_id=507aca5a1b653700efd8a79b2d4bcb59), which is also your <https://code.harvard.edu> username (something similar to `abc123`). Make sure you log in to [https://code.harvard.edu/](https://code.harvard.edu/) before submitting your NetID.

### <a id="class-forum"></a><a class="anchor-link" href="#class-forum">Class Discussion</a>

We will use the Ed Discussion forum on our Canvas page as our main communication platform. Questions regarding homework, labs or lecture material must be posted on this forum and you are encouraged to reply to questions if you know the answer or you can share a useful contribution. A Slack channel will also be provided. It can be accessed on the Slack option on the left menu of Canvas.
